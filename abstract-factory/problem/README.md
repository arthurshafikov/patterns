# Abstract-Factory Problem

The problem is we always want to see same types of furniture _family_ together. We don't want to order _Modern chair_, _Modern sofa_ and _Victorian coffee table_. In this example you can easily mix them up, and if it's not you who do that, it could be new programmers in the project. 

So of course we want to prevent that opportunity and keep our code strict.
